The component can take an optional 'pattern' string prop like: 'Days {d} Hours {hh} Minutes {mm} Seconds {SS} Millis {sss}'.

The component can also take a number of children. These could be:
 - Any element really that we can stick in our input area.
 - DurationControlUnit nodes.

 The presence of having any child nodes will override the pattern.

 The DurationControlUnit acts as a pattern for one unit (day/hour/minute/second/milli) where the input is '{v}' (or '{vvv}' for 000)
 The DurationControlUnit will have props to handle input focus at the unit level and apply a style to the unit?

 Will the value be stored as seconds or an object with properties for each unit?
