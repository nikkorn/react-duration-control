The component can take an optional 'pattern' string prop like:  'Days {d} Hours {hh} Minutes {mm} Seconds {SS} Millis {sss}'.
This would show as Days [0] Hours [00] Minutes [00] Seconds [00] Millis [000] where the input maxLength matches and the digits values are always padded with 0.
See: https://www.jqueryscript.net/demo/accessible-duration-picker/
Others: https://www.jqueryscript.net/tags.php?/Duration%20Picker/

The component can also take a number of children. These could be:
 - Any element really that we can stick in our input area.
 - DurationControlUnit nodes.

 The presence of having any child nodes will override the pattern.

 The DurationControlUnit acts as a pattern for one unit (day/hour/minute/second/milli) where the input is '{v}' (or '{vvv}' for 000)
 The DurationControlUnit will have props to handle input focus at the unit level and apply a style to the unit?

 Will the value be stored as seconds or an object with properties for each unit?

 Do we want both controlled and uncontrolled? Probably just controlled with a 'value' and 'onChange' prop.

 inputs have maxLength

 If an input is empty it should show a default value of 0

 Should have a prop for amount to increment per unit on arrow click or up/down press.
